**Title**: How Mood Detection Works
**Category**: Brewing & Operation
**Applies to**: Pro, Home, Office, Cafe

**Content**:
Mood detection combines biometric data (skin conductivity ±0.05 µS range), facial recognition, and environmental context. For example:

* Higher stress = stronger coffee (205°F, 18 bars).
* Fatigue = higher caffeine extraction.
* Relaxed mood = lower temperature (195°F), smoother brew.

**Tip**: If you prefer manual override, disable auto-mode in the app.

Each mood maps to a default brew strength, but you can adjust it:

1. Open the MoodBrew app.
2. Go to **Preferences > Mood Mapping**.
3. For each mood (Energize, Comfort, Focus, Relax), slide strength from 1–10.

Changes are saved to your profile. Pro and Cafe models allow per-user mood mapping.
