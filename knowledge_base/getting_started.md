**Category**: Getting Started
**Applies to**: MoodBrew Pro, MoodBrew Home, MoodBrew Office, MoodBrew Cafe

**Content**:
When you first unbox your MoodBrew machine, you'll find the unit itself, a removable water tank, power cord, starter water filter (MB-WF01), a cleaning cloth for sensors, and a Quick Start guide. The Pro and Cafe models also include a metal tamper and extra filter basket.

To set up:

1. Remove all protective packaging.
2. Insert the water filter into the tank (pre-soak for 5 minutes first).
3. Place the machine on a flat, dry surface, at least 4 inches from walls for ventilation.
4. Plug in the power cord.
5. Fill the water tank with fresh, cold water.

The machine will power on and prompt you to run the first-time calibration (see related article).

**Title**: First-Time Calibration
**Category**: Getting Started
**Applies to**: All models

**Content**:
Calibration ensures your MoodBrew senses your mood accurately. The built-in biometric sensor (infrared + skin conductivity) must learn your baseline.

Steps:

1. Turn on the machine.
2. On-screen instructions will guide you to place your hand on the mood pad for 10 seconds.
3. For Pro and Cafe models, look into the facial recognition sensor (infrared + ambient light capture).
4. Repeat twice for accuracy.

Calibration adjusts water flow, brew temperature (195–205°F), and pressure to your personal profile.

**Pro Tip**: Redo calibration if multiple household members use the machine. Up to 6 profiles can be stored (Pro, Office, Cafe).

**Title**: Understanding Mood Detection Sensors
**Category**: Getting Started
**Applies to**: Pro, Office, Cafe (Home has simplified sensors)

**Content**:
MoodBrew uses a combination of:

* **Infrared facial scanning** (Pro, Office, Cafe)
* **Skin conductivity pad** (all models)
* **Ambient light & temperature sensor** (all models)
* **Micro-expression analysis camera** (Pro, Cafe only)

These sensors work together to detect stress, fatigue, or calm states, mapping them to brew modes.
