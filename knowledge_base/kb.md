## 1. Getting Started

---

**Title**: Unboxing and Initial Setup
**Category**: Getting Started
**Applies to**: MoodBrew Pro, MoodBrew Home, MoodBrew Office, MoodBrew Cafe

**Content**:
When you first unbox your MoodBrew machine, you’ll find the unit itself, a removable water tank, power cord, starter water filter (MB-WF01), a cleaning cloth for sensors, and a Quick Start guide. The Pro and Cafe models also include a metal tamper and extra filter basket.

To set up:

1. Remove all protective packaging.
2. Insert the water filter into the tank (pre-soak for 5 minutes first).
3. Place the machine on a flat, dry surface, at least 4 inches from walls for ventilation.
4. Plug in the power cord.
5. Fill the water tank with fresh, cold water.

The machine will power on and prompt you to run the first-time calibration (see related article).

**Title**: First-Time Calibration
**Category**: Getting Started
**Applies to**: All models

**Content**:
Calibration ensures your MoodBrew senses your mood accurately. The built-in biometric sensor (infrared + skin conductivity) must learn your baseline.

Steps:

1. Turn on the machine.
2. On-screen instructions will guide you to place your hand on the mood pad for 10 seconds.
3. For Pro and Cafe models, look into the facial recognition sensor (infrared + ambient light capture).
4. Repeat twice for accuracy.

Calibration adjusts water flow, brew temperature (195–205°F), and pressure to your personal profile.

**Pro Tip**: Redo calibration if multiple household members use the machine. Up to 6 profiles can be stored (Pro, Office, Cafe).

**Title**: Connecting to WiFi and the MoodBrew Mobile App
**Category**: Getting Started
**Applies to**: All models

**Content**:
MoodBrew connects to 2.4GHz or 5GHz WiFi. Use the app (iOS/Android) to control brewing remotely, schedule brews, and view mood logs.

Steps:

1. Open the MoodBrew app.
2. Create an account and tap **Add New Device**.
3. Select your model and follow the pairing instructions.
4. On the machine, hold the WiFi button for 5 seconds until MB-001 appears.
5. Enter your WiFi credentials in the app.

Once connected, the LED light will turn blue.

**Troubleshooting Tip**: If connection fails, ensure your router isn’t set to WPA3-only mode.

**Title**: Understanding Mood Detection Sensors
**Category**: Getting Started
**Applies to**: Pro, Office, Cafe (Home has simplified sensors)

**Content**:
MoodBrew uses a combination of:

* **Infrared facial scanning** (Pro, Office, Cafe)
* **Skin conductivity pad** (all models)
* **Ambient light & temperature sensor** (all models)
* **Micro-expression analysis camera** (Pro, Cafe only)

These sensors work together to detect stress, fatigue, or calm states, mapping them to brew modes.

## 2. Brewing & Operation

---

**Title**: How Mood Detection Works
**Category**: Brewing & Operation
**Applies to**: Pro, Home, Office, Cafe

**Content**:
Mood detection combines biometric data (skin conductivity ±0.05 µS range), facial recognition, and environmental context. For example:

* Higher stress = stronger coffee (205°F, 18 bars).
* Fatigue = higher caffeine extraction.
* Relaxed mood = lower temperature (195°F), smoother brew.

**Tip**: If you prefer manual override, disable auto-mode in the app.

**Title**: Customizing Coffee Strength Based on Mood
**Category**: Brewing & Operation
**Applies to**: All models

**Content**:
Each mood maps to a default brew strength, but you can adjust it:

1. Open the MoodBrew app.
2. Go to **Preferences > Mood Mapping**.
3. For each mood (Energize, Comfort, Focus, Relax), slide strength from 1–10.

Changes are saved to your profile. Pro and Cafe models allow per-user mood mapping.

**Title**: Programming Automatic Brewing Schedules
**Category**: Brewing & Operation
**Applies to**: Pro, Office, Cafe

**Content**:
You can schedule brewing via the mobile app:

1. Open **Schedules** tab.
2. Select time and day(s).
3. Choose mood mode or fixed brew strength.
4. Save.

Office and Cafe models support up to 50 schedules for shared environments.

**Pro Tip**: Use geofencing in the app to auto-start brewing when you arrive home.

**Title**: Understanding Brewing Modes
**Category**: Brewing & Operation
**Applies to**: All models

**Content**:
MoodBrew supports four core modes:

* **Energize**: High pressure, hot extraction (205°F, 18 bars).
* **Comfort**: Balanced extraction, medium strength.
* **Focus**: Smooth, lower bitterness, optimized caffeine.
* **Relax**: Cooler brew (195°F), reduced caffeine extraction.

**Tip**: Pro and Cafe models allow creating custom modes.

**Title**: Daily Cleaning Routine
**Category**: Maintenance & Cleaning
**Applies to**: All models

**Content**:

* Empty drip tray and rinse.
* Wipe mood sensors with microfiber cloth.
* Rinse water tank and refill.

**Title**: Deep Cleaning and Descaling
**Category**: Maintenance & Cleaning
**Applies to**: All models

**Content**:
Every 4–6 weeks, descale with MB-DC02 solution.

Steps:

1. Fill tank with solution and water.
2. Run Descale mode.
3. Rinse twice with fresh water.

Office and Cafe require more frequent descaling due to higher volume.
