## üéÆ Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Sign Up/Login**: Create an agent account to access the dashboard
2. **Explore Sample Tickets**: The seed data includes various MoodBrew support scenarios
3. **Try AI Analysis**: Click "Analyze" on any ticket to see AI-powered insights
4. **Generate Demo Tickets**: Use the "Generate Demo Ticket" feature for realistic test data

### Core Workflows

#### üé≠ Generating Demo Tickets
Perfect for testing and demonstrations:

1. Navigate to **Create New Ticket** (`/tickets/new`)
2. Click **"Generate Demo Ticket"** in the purple section
3. Watch AI create realistic MoodBrew scenarios with customer personalities
4. Modify the generated data or create another scenario
5. Submit to create the ticket

**Sample Generated Scenarios:**
- "Coffee emergency! Machine thinks I'm always sad ‚òπÔ∏è"
- "Feature request: Hangover mode please! üç∑‚û°Ô∏è‚òï"
- "App won't connect to my MoodBrew Office"

#### ü§ñ AI Ticket Analysis
Transform raw support requests into actionable insights:

1. Open any ticket from the dashboard
2. Click **"Analyze with AI"** 
3. AI analyzes using MoodBrew knowledge base context
4. Review generated tags, priority, sentiment, and summary
5. Approve, modify, or reject AI suggestions
6. Generate customer response suggestions

#### üìä Monitoring AI Performance
Track how well your AI is performing:

1. Visit **Admin > Background Jobs** for detailed job monitoring
2. Check **Analytics Dashboard** for AI accuracy metrics
3. Review individual ticket analysis debug data
4. Monitor processing times and success rates

### Advanced Features

#### üîç Debug Mode
For development and troubleshooting:

```ruby
# Rails console debugging
bin/rails console

# Test AI service directly
> ticket = Ticket.first
> service = AiService.new(true)  # Enable debug mode
> result = service.analyze_ticket(ticket)

# Check background job details
> job = BackgroundJob.recent.first
> job.processing_steps  # Step-by-step execution
> job.console_logs      # Complete debug output
```

#### üîß Background Job Monitoring
Real-time visibility into AI processing:

- **Job Dashboard**: `/admin/background_jobs`
- **Individual Job Details**: Complete request/response data
- **Retry Management**: Automatic exponential backoff
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging with stack traces

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Backend** | Ruby on Rails 8 | Web framework with modern conventions |
| **Database** | MongoDB + Mongoid | Flexible document storage for AI metadata |
| **AI Integration** | DigitalOcean Agent | Specialized AI agent with built-in RAG capabilities |
| **Frontend** | Tailwind CSS + Stimulus | Modern, responsive UI with interactive features |
| **Background Jobs** | Sidekiq | Reliable AI processing with retry logic |
| **Testing** | RSpec + VCR + Factory Bot | Comprehensive test coverage with AI mocking |

### Data Model Highlights

```ruby
# Ticket with embedded documents (MongoDB advantage)
class Ticket
  include Mongoid::Document
  
  field :subject, type: String
  field :description, type: String
  field :priority, type: String
  field :status, type: String
  
  # AI analysis embedded directly in ticket
  embeds_one :ai_analysis
  
  # Customer info embedded for performance
  embeds_one :customer_info
  
  # Messages embedded for complete ticket context
  embeds_many :messages
end
```

### AI Service Architecture

```ruby
# DigitalOcean Agent integration with built-in RAG
class AiService
  def analyze_ticket(ticket, include_response = true)
    # 1. Build comprehensive analysis prompt
    prompt = build_analysis_prompt(ticket)
    
    # 2. Call DigitalOcean Agent with RAG retrieval enabled
    response = @client.chat(
      parameters: {
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
        extra_body: {
          include_retrieval_info: true,
          include_functions_info: true
        }
      }
    )
    
    # 3. Parse structured JSON response with confidence scoring
    analysis_result = parse_ai_response(response, ticket)
    
    # 4. Generate customer response if high confidence (>70%)
    if include_response && analysis_result[:confidence_score] > 0.7
      analysis_result[:suggested_response] = generate_response(ticket)
    end
    
    # 5. Store complete processing details for monitoring
    store_debug_data(response, analysis_result)
  end
end
```
